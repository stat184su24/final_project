This is an outline for your Initial EDA. You can follow this outline, or you can modify it as you see fit. Do what works best for your project. 

## Research Question 

State your specific research question and why it is interesting. 



## Data Processing 

#### Data Intake 

Include R code and written explanation to import your **TWO** data sets.

#### Data Wrangling 

Include R code and written explanation for wangling your data (you can make multiple wrangled data sets). 




## Data Visualization

#### Plot 1

Include R code to make one data visualization (I would encourage you to use 3 or more variables). Include a brief written description of what your graph shows. Is this graph helpful in answering your research question? If it is helpful, will you need to add/modify anything in this graph in the final report? 

#### Plot 2

Include R code to make one data visualization (I would encourage you to use 3 or more variables). Include a brief written description of what your graph shows. Is this graph helpful in answering your research question? If it is helpful, will you need to add/modify anything in this graph in the final report? 


## Conclusion

Include your initial intuition as to what the answer to your research question is using the data sets and visualizations you created.
